# v2 extensions

The proposed extensions are:
- Segregation of output in tasks.
- A ncurses interface.
- Dynamic messages for TCP and UDP clients.
- Creation of simple utilities in libric to facilitate implementation of
  libric(such as a function to send a TCP message, and so).

Solutions:
- Segregation achieved over copies of the previous via global static variables,
  via new functions.
