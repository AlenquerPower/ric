# ric

"Weddings are basically funerals with cake."

by Rick, from "Rick and Morty"

ric is an implementation of:
- Sanguino, J., "A Quick Guide to Networking Software", 5th Edition, Feb 2020

It also aggregates all tasks into a single program called ric.

The name is a pun to the Course from which the guide is (RCI), as well as the
spirit of the project itself, which tries to expose more of the cool stuff, in
a bold and sarcastic manner of the one Rick.

## Correspondence

- hname.c        -- task 1: gethostname
- nslook.c       -- task 2: getaddrinfo
- udp\_client.c   -- task 3, 4, 5: udp\_client
- tcp\_client.c   -- task 6, 7, 8: tcp\_client
- udp\_server.c   -- task 9: udp\_server
- tcp\_server.c   -- task 10, 11, 12: tcp\_server


## ric's flags

- n  -> Task n(hostname)                          -> Task 1
- w  -> Task w(who is it, weak nslookup)          -> Task 2
- u  -> Task udp\_client                           -> Task 3, 4, 5
- t  -> Task tcp\_client                           -> Task 6, 7, 8
- l  -> multiplexes u and t to servers
    + u  -> Task udp\_server                       -> Task 9
    + t  -> Task tcp\_server                       -> Task 10, 11, 12
